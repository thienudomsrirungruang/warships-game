# Warships
A simple client-server terminal battleships clone.

### Quick start
#### Client
Download `client/main.py` and `client/settings.py` in the same folder. Change the parameters in `settings.py` to the server location.

Alternatively, you can remove the `import settings` line in `main.py` and edit the final line.

The code can only be run on Windows, outside of IDLE.

#### Server
Download `server/main.py`. Run using `main.py <port>`. If a port is not specified, it will run on port `5005`.
